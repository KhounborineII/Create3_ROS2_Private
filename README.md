# iRobot Create3 ROS2 Introduction

This project was heavily based upon the work of [@paccionesawyer](https://github.com/paccionesawyer) and cloned from [This](https://github.com/paccionesawyer/Create3_ROS2_Intro) repository. The programs here will be extensions of his work as I further develop my skills of creating python programs for the iRobot Create 3 ROS 2.0.
